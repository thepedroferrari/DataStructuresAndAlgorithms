TASK 1:
How many different telephone numbers are there in the records? 
Print a message:
"There are <count> different telephone numbers in the records."

# Work through some examples by hand.

# Steps:
# 1. Create new list of uniques:
# 2. Look into every list item, one by one
# 3. Check if the value of the item already exists in the unique list.
# 4. If it does, move next
# 5. If it does not, add the value to the unique list and then move next.
# 6. repeat until all lists are done.

# Simple mechanical solution
# inputs:
# list1 = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7]
# list2 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 9]
# expected output: [0,1,2,3,5,7,9]


# def getListOfUniques(l1, l2):
#     unique_list = []
#     for item in l1:
#         if item not in unique_list:
#             unique_list.append(item)
#
#     for item in l2:
#         if item not in unique_list:
#             unique_list.append(item)
#
#     return unique_list
#
#
# assert getListOfUniques(list1, list2), [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 19]
#
#
# def test():
#     result = getListOfUniques(list1, list2)
#     if result != [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9]:
#         print("Test with data:", list1, list2, "failed")
#     else:
#         print("Test case passed!")
#
# test()


# Develop incrementally and test as you go
# the lists we have are a csv, and we need to first get the values that we need from these lists
# into a new list. 2 lists would be worsts case O(2n) considering both lists of equal maximum length
# the uniqueness may be simpler by transforming the two lists into a set, but then we will also have O(2n) again.
# then getting the length of the set O(1). We could perform the addition to the new list directly from the lists
# itself, since we won't be needing the lists with just the numbers.
# moreover, we need the number of callers and receivers.
#

# Calculating O:
# Input for this function will be n number of arrays.
# for every array, we will iterate n number of times
# every time we iterate, we will perform two comparisons and at most two more O(n) operations
# There are two for loops operations, that for this exercise I will count each of them as 1 operation
# we declare one list and print at the end with len operation
# this should be O(nÂ²) and could possibly be made better by using sets.

# def getListOfUniqueValuesFromListsOfLists2(arr1, arr2):
#     arrays = [*arr1, *arr2]
#     uniqueValues = []
#     for item in arrays:
#         if not item[0] in uniqueValues:
#             uniqueValues.append(item[0])
#         if not item[1] in uniqueValues:
#             uniqueValues.append(item[1])
#     return "There are " + str(len(uniqueValues)) + " different telephone numbers in the records."
#
#
# print(getListOfUniqueValuesFromListsOfLists2(calls, texts))

# Udacity Feedback:
# Learned: If-in on sets and dictionaries are O(1), not O(n) since they use HashMapping. Which makes sense since no
# loop is needed to find the value I am searching for. Same should go for list[index].
# Then, it is better to create a set for the numbers in the two lists.
# This will give us a O(2n) operation, simplified to O(n)
